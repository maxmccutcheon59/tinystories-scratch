## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email **MaxMcCutcheon1@outlook.com** with:

- A description of the issue and impact

- Your preferred contact for follow-up

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports until a fix or disclosure plan is agreed.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days.

## Scope notes

This repository is offline research / ML training code. It does not run a network service by default. Still in scope: dependency vulnerabilities, secret leakage in the repo, unsafe deserialization of untrusted checkpoints (`torch.load`), and CI supply-chain issues.

Treat third-party checkpoint files as untrusted; only load artifacts you produced or obtained from a trusted source.

## Incident basics

If a secret is ever committed: rotate the credential first, then purge history. Enable GitHub secret scanning / push protection on the repository when available.
